# Coupling-Design-For-Different-Kinds-Of-Optimization-Constraints
This is the course project for EE746-Neuromorphic Engineering at IIT Bombay.


In order to run the code : -

1] The main.m and main_1.m are the files which are required to initialize the network
   and recognize pattern along with figures on the accuracy of the model respectively.
2] All other files are functions and the supporting material files which should be loaded
   in the matlab before running main files.
3] After loading all the supporting and function files, please run main.m file to see the
   initialized pattern or to initialize the network.
4] Then, run main_1.m file to observe the recognized pattern and accuracy.
